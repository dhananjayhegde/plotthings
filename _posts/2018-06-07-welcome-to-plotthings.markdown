As of now, I do not have any great misson with this repo.
This will serve as a learning stage for me and hopefully someone else too who is just beginning with matplotlib, data science and dat avisualization etc.

Also, this will give me a hands on experience in maintaining GitHub repo.

This can be used a boilerplate for various plotting, data science stuffs. 
I would highly appreciate if you can contribute some interesting yet simple charting techniques.
