# plotthings

Plot your imagination!


## How to use

As of now, I do not have any great misson with this repo.
This will serve as a learning stage for me and hopefully someone else too who is just beginning with matplotlib, data science and data avisualization etc.

Also, this will give me a hands on experience in maintaining GitHub repo.

This can be used a boilerplate for various plotting, data science stuffs. 
I would highly appreciate if you can contribute some interesting yet simple charting techniques.

## How it is done

	- I am using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to build the posts
	- Theme used is [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/)
	- I create Jupyter Notebooks and then download them as `.html` pages and then add them to `_posts/` folder

As of now, I am doing it manually.  I am not sure if I can use any automation tools to do this.  I will explore some.

##### Note: such Jupyter Notebooks do not contain the FrontMatter variable `layout: post` 
This is because it causes the page to be rendered to right-part of the browser which creates a horozontal scroll bar.



## How to add new posts

	- Fork the repo
	- Add new post in `_posts/` folder
	- Make sure name it `yyyy-mm-dd-post-name.md` or `yyyy-mm-dd-post-name.markdow` or `yyyy-mm-dd-post-name.html`
	- Make sure to include the YAML **FrontMatter** else it will it not be picked for *build* by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
	- Once done, I will really appreciate if you create a pull request
